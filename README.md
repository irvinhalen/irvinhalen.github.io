# Irvin Halen


## Introduction

My name is Irvin and I am a software engineer. I like building cool projects that I find fun.

irvinhalen.github.io is a personal website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) meant to showcase my work. Feel free to take a look under the hood by following the instructions under Setup.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file on the root directory of this project
    - Make sure to replace NUMBER below with actual number values you want to set as a password for the /gamer path of the application
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAMER_PASSWORD=NUMBER
```
2. Install the dependencies by running the command
```sh
npm install
```
3. Run the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
4. Open the URL, [http://localhost:1010](http://localhost:1010), on your browser to view the website on your local machine.
